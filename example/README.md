The repo provides a few examples on how to use the SDK. The three main methods are:

- `createReferralAccount`: To create your own referral account to use with Jupiter.
- `createReferralTokenAccount`: To create your own referral token account to receive the token fee.
- `claimAll`: To claim all the token fees.
